Data files uploaded to G4ChannelingFastSimCrystalData for the simulations of channeling trajectories.

The file name has the following format:
<material>_<type(planes or axes)>_<crystallographic direction>.dat

The data include the properties of the crystal lattice of a certain material and in a certain crystallographic direction (along either crystal planes or axes),
in particular: 
-electric field: x-component
-electric field: y-component (only in the case of crystal axes => 2D model)
-normalized atomic density (normalized to the amorphous density)
-electron density
-minimal energy of ionization

All of these values are the functions of x (for crystal planes) or x and y (for crystal axes) within single periodic cell.
The functions are saved in the form of interpolation coefficients of cubic splines either 1D [1] for planes and 2D [2] for axes 
based on equidistant nodes.

The file format:

atomic density [cm^-3]
amplutide of thermal vibrations [cm]
cell size x [cm]
cell size y [cm] (only for axes)
number of interpolation intervals on x (number_of_nodes - 1)
number of interpolation intervals on x (number_of_nodes - 1)  (only for axes)
maximum of the potential (0 is in the minimum) [eV]
minimal potential inside the crystal [eV]
---in period on every interpolation interval--- :
interpolation coefficients for electric field: x-component [eV/cm]
interpolation coefficients for electric field: y-component [eV/cm] (only in the case of crystal axes => 2D model)
normalized atomic density (in period on every element of the material)
electron density [cm^-3]
minimal energy of ionization [eV]

CAUTION: the calculation of all the functions is based on the data in the beggining of the file. 
Nothing in this file can be changed without changing all the other data!

CAUTION: the amplutide of thermal vibrations is calculated for the room temperature [3].
